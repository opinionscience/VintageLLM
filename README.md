# VintageLLM
A repository of early modern instructions (from late middle ages to 18th century). For now this include:
* 2000 instructions from French novels published between 1600 and 1700.
* 1670 instructions from English monographies published until 1700 (EEBO).

All the instructions have been created from public domain works with historical writing and typography. 

Beyond their cultural relevance, VintageLLM instructions provide a very good sample for fine-tuning demonstration, as even a small set will dramatically change the output of the LLM.
