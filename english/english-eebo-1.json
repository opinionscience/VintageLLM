The Proceedings in this Case of Sir Richard le Scrope, was (as I find) when Thomas Arundel, Bishop of Ely, and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, was Chancellor; who, no doubt, did much influence the King and Council, in making the Decree.

For if Antonius Pius could truly say, Postquam ad imperium transcivimus, etiam quae prius habuimus perdidimus ; how farre distant are they from truth which makes Kings gainers, and subjects loosers by their inthronization? M. Anton. Phil. having by law, the sole, intire disposition of the publick Treasure, yet upon his expedition into Scythia, would not make use of the same without the Senates consent, but professed openly, Eam pecuniam, caeteraque omnia esse Senatus Populisque Rom. nos enim usque adeo nihil habemus proprium, ut etiam vestras habitemus aedes. How diametrically opposite is this to that which our State-Theologues doe now buzze into the Kings eares? They instead of giving the subjects a just and compleat propriety in the King, resigne the subject and all that he possesses to the meer discretion of the King, instead of restraining Princes where the lawes let them loose, they let loose Princes where the law restraines them.

For a King may do that which our Lord Christ in his state of humiliation would not do. He would not divide an inheritance among brethren, Luke 12. 13, 14. and yet a king may do it. For though Christ was King in right, yet he refused at that time to take upon him, or to execute the office of a King, but took upon him the form of a servant, Phil. 2. 7. And therefore a King on his throne is not debarred from doing that which Christ would not do in his debasement. And yet even then the Lord Christ did whip the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, John 2. 15, 16. Mat. 21. 12. I will not now dispute, whether Christ did this jure zelotarum, by the right that Zelots of the Law among the Jews, claimed to themselves; or jure Regio, by the right of a King, under which notion acclamation was made to him when he rode on an Ass into Jerusalem, Luke 19. 38. after which he did expel the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, ver. 45. nor whether this be a good proof for Magistrates, to intermeddle in matters of Religion, as it hath been argued by Mr. Cobbet of New England. It is sufficient for my present purpose, that the alledging of Christs example by these Petitioners, is so far from making against the Kings power in Ecclesiastical causes, that it rather makes for it. Nor is it against the Kings power in causes Ecclesiastical that the Lord Jesus himself, nor his disciples, never would by any outward force compel men to receive them or their doctrine. For, besides what is already said of Christs example, there is a great difference to be made between professed infidels, and disorderly Christians; between planting of the Gospel at first, and resorming Christians who have in shew received it, there may be reason to do the latter by civil penalties, though not the former, though men are not to be made Christians by civil penalties, sith Religion is not to be inforced, but perswaded, yet being Christians they may be corrected by civil penalties.

For Constantius took away the Churches from Athanasius and his Adherents, which is the State-way of depriving Bishops; and gave them to George the Anti-Bishop and his Adherents. Nay, he sends an Edict, to the Senate and People of Alexandria, * requiring them on their Allegiance, (instead of sticking to him as their spiritual Head, with the Affection and Dependance of Members;) with their united Force, to persecute Athanasius. And made it criminal in any Persons, as Sozomen † relates, to harbour or conceal him. And accordingly the Imperial Ministers and Praefects, violently drove him and the Orthodox out of the Churches; and, by extream Force, put George and the Arians, in possession thereof: And, having placed this Anti-Bishop upon his Throne, with all secular Cruelties and barbarous Usage, compell'd the Clergy and People to acknowledge and submit to him. It was also brought about by Deprivation of Synods. For after the Sardican Synod, which restored him, Athanasius had been again deposed, both by the Synod of Arles, and afterwards by the Synod of Milan, wherein, besides a few from the East, above three hundred Bishops of the West met, as Sozomen * says, and condemned him. And the setting up of George against him after this, was in a Synod, viz. the Synod of Antioch, ‖ which declared the Uncanonicalness of his Restitution, and Ordained George, as a former Synod at that place had Ordained Gregory before, to be Bishop of Alexandria in his Room. These, indeed, as the Author of the Vindication * suggests, were Heretical Synods. And Dionysius of Alba, Eusebius of Vercelles, Paulinus of Tryers, and Rhodanus, and Lucifer, who at Milan protested against their Proceedings, declared, that, thro' Athanasius, the Emperor and the Arians his Enemies, were striking at the Catholick Faith; which the event of things, and the Proceedings afterwards in the Synods of Ariminum and Seleucia, verified, as Sozomen * observes. But in way of external Judicature, the Deprivation, tho' of Heretical Synods, must at least carry with it as much Plea, as Deposition by no Synods can pretend to; there being more shew of Ecclesiastical Authority, in Acts of Heretical Synods, than in none at all. But for all this Deposition, both by the Imperial Edicts, and Synodical Sentences, since the true Cause thereof was his firmness and constancy to the Catholick Faith, Athanasius, as the foresaid Author owns, still kept on his spiritual Relation, and the People their spiritual and Religious Obligations to, and Dependance on him.

And yet with what admirable patience doth he take it? How calm is he? How far from murmuring? And what wrought him to this pass? even this consideration, h It is the Lord, let him do as seemeth him good. You have heard of the sufferings of Job, yea, I am sure you never heard of any meer mans sufferings like his. He was so afflicted in his estate, in his servants, in his children, in his wife, in his friends, in his body from head to foot, in his soul, that there seemed to be no place left, wherein to inflict a new wound. How doth he take all this? Doth he not storm, and rage? doth he not despond, and despair? No, he kisseth the rod, is dumb, and holds his peace, though provoked to impatience by the instigation of his wife, and upbraided by her, for serving a God that used him no better. What was it, that could possibly make a man take all this so patiently? This very consideration in my Text wrought him to this composedness; i God hath given, God hath taken. And when afterward he had a little forgotten himself, and spoken unadvisedly, God was pleased but to remember him, whose k hand his afflictions came from, and that presently reduced his soul to his first calmness. l I am vile, what shall I answer?

King Asa did otherwise and was blamed for it, * namely, that when he was diseased he sought not to the Lord, but to physitians. Thou mayst repair to the Physitian, but remember that thou seekest to God first and beggest his blessing chiefly; for it is only under the conduct of Divine Providence, that those outward means and supplies, helps and medicines do take effect. And so likewise if you have any thoughts of changing your place, and flying from the danger, be sure to take God along with you. This the very Heathens were carefull of, who thought themselves safe where ever they iourneyed, so they carried their gods along with them. Thus they tell us of Aeneas, that when Troy was on fire, he was no less mindful of rescuing his houshold gods, then of bringing away his old d • crepid father on his back: you must think he reckoned so sacred and venerable a load as his best protection, and that which would serve to lighten his future calamities. And shall I add what some have conjectured concerning Rachels stealing her Fathers Images, viz. That she was somewhat infected with the Idolatry of Labans family, and so being to leave Padan-Aram, she would rather rob her Father then go without those little Moveable and Guardian gods. As for thee, if thou intendest to shift thy place, forget not to take the God of thy fathers along with thee, even the great God of heaven and earth. Be sure that thou flyest not away from the Town where Infection is, that thou mayst sin more securely in another place: remember God sees thee, and can send his flying arrows after thee, though thou doest immure thy self never so closely. Rather make thy peace with God, and get the blood of Iesus the Lamb of God sprinkl • d upon thy soul, that so the destroying Angel may pass over thee: where ever thou art make the most High thy confidence, * so thou shalt be best secured.

Chap. 11. v. 3. Ruminating with my self upon the aptness of these words to the present times, I was invited by my curiosity to reflect and dive into their sense, whereupon I found they related to other Chapters, as well as the matter in this; their Latitude comprehending all the remarkable Revolutions foretold by John. But above all this Verse has such a direct, immediate aspect and intuition upon the Fall of Babylon, threatned in a following Chapter, which our Protestant Divines conclude to be the Church of Rome; that it seems to squint only, and look awry at other Passages, but to appear with a full and gazing face upon this Prediction. The Prophecy of the Down-fall of the See of Rome we all know to be yet uncompleated; the foreboding Signs and Tokens of this Calamity are two preliminary Witnesses that shall prophecy; and as it is Gods usual Method when He intends to strike, to give warning of the Blow; so here it was reveal'd to John to declare, That the Almighty would send two Witnesses to prophecy, and give Evidence of the Whoredoms and Villanies of this Spiritual Strumpet, to discover the dark Intrigues of this Hellish Plot, to bring the Conspirators to a just Punishment, to free us all from the Tyranny and Yoke of Popery, and finally to batter down that Monster of Religion, and Bawd of Sin and Iniquity, the Pope himself. It may perhaps be ask'd, why Holy John mentions two Witnesses indefinitely without offering at some description of the Instruments in this Great Work? I answer, 'twas policy in him to mention them by the general character of Witnesses; he would not give plain and signal Marks of the Persons that were by an Eternal Providence pitch'd upon to over-turn this damnable Design, an Ignatian sort of People, whom he well knew to be ready charg'd with revenge and malice, by such a light given of the Discoverers, might have murdered or strangled them as Instruments intended to mischief their Cause, and quench the red-hot Iron upon the Anvel."},{"instruction_id":"460","instruction":"What kind of dumbness and silence does the Psalmist in the text demonstrate, and why is it considered a suitable response to suffering under God's hand?","input":"","output":"The blinde and Heathenish Philistims (indeed) when they smarted under Gods judgements, fansied it might be h only some chance had happened unto them, and there was an end: But as for us we have been taught to know God better than so, and therefore ought to entertain no such Paganish conceits.

If it will not, it shall be made to bow. The Syriack saith, it should bow, so doth Erasmus, Beza, &c. if it doe not, it ought to bow. Some Passively, Actively others, the word carries both, and the difference makes no oddes. If the Fathers call it subjection, adoration, or worship; what if they doe? May it not therefore come at the body? Nay, the outward bowing proceeding from the lowly minde, unto the right object is the reall and full subjection, adoration, or worship, which God requireth at the Name. For the bowing of the Knee is not onely a signe of inward subjection, but being with the heart is true subjection it selfe. Adoration it is, and to adore is to honour in the highest degree, that is with the lowest expression. For in adoration is ever implyed a threefold act. First, an apprehension of excellencie: If there be no preeminence, it is adulation. Secondly, an acknowledgement of what is so apprehended; If the acknowledgement be not serious, it is derision. Thirdly, an evidence of our subjection: If there be no cleare demonstration, either by prostration, or genuflection, or inclination, or other expression, the worship is not complete. We may be in the Temple, and our minds farre off; if there, they must shew, or cannot be knowne there.

IV. Obedience to rightful Authority, not tied to actual Administration of Government. HAving thus cleared the first Point, That Authority is to go by Human Right; I now procede to the second, viz. to show, That Obedience is due to Authority, and not merely to the actual Exercise thereof, or to Administration of Government. The Duty of Subjects, he * thinks, is only to submit to a Prince, when he actually Administers. If he doth not actually administer; Obedience, in his Notion, is not his Right; nor is paying that Obedience, to him who doth actually Govern, giving away his Right: Obedience and Submission being due to him only whilst he is in Possession of the Throne. And this is another main Point, which he still supposes, and builds on. But as he who has the Right may appear, from what is already said, to have the Authority; I shall now show, That he who has the Authority, must have the Duty and Allegiance which the Commandments call for to the Authority; and that, whether he be in Place to exercise it, or no. Indeed, when he cannot exercise his Authority, Subjects cannot obey or disobey an ejected Prince, in that Exercise. As for Instance, they cannot obey him in his due Proclamations, or legal Commands, when he can issue out none; nor in Courts and Officers, when they do not proceed in his Name, or act by any Commission from him, unless, according to the Opinion of some, for the Maintenance and Course of Justice, he may be thought and shown to derive some Authority to them, which I leave others to determine. But the main of Obedience, is keeping under Obedience, or owning the Authority of his Person, and our own Subjection and Obligation to him: And there is no Breach of Obedience, like to that of casting off all Obedience. To disobey him in any particular Act of exercising his Authority, is only ill, as it is an Infringement and Violation of the Authority of his Person; and to throw off all Obedience, is an utter Abolition and absolute Denial thereof. The former may be the Offence of a Subject; but the later, of one that owes no Subjection. When a Man only disobeys him in exercising his Authority, though he disobeys him in one thing, he may be ready to obey him in every other thing: But when he throws off his Authority, and Obedience it self, from that time he is for obeying him in nothing at all. Though therefore, as he says, (p. 26.) there is no Duty Subjects owe to Princes, as Subjects, but to obey them; yet is there Obedience to those that cannot actually govern, and room enough for Subjects to disobey them: Not to disobey them in actual Government, but in what is worse than that."},{"instruction_id":"1602","instruction":"Can you write a short text discussing the potential impact of the increase or decrease in English shipping and mariners on the sovereignty of the British Seas to the Crown of England?

Besides, the only reason which this Gentleman gives, pag. 11. why, if we hold Nehemiah and Iosephus to speak of the same Sanballat, it is necessary to make Nehemiah 's Artaxerxes to be Mnemon, not Longimanus, is because the Sanballat, that was the Adversary of the Iews in the 29th year of Longimanus, must have been much above 120 years old in Alexander 's time.

Whatever Allowance, under the favour of Necessity, men may have to keep on with such, of which Plea of necessity, I shall say more hereafter; yet, where there is choice of others more Orthodox, they are no longer tyed to such Pastors, as openly and obstinately preach up damnable practices, to disgrace Religion, and endanger Souls. Bear they may for a time, in hopes of Reformation; and, because it is easier, to prevent, than to patch up Breaches, wise Lovers both of Peace and Truth, would not be hasty in coming to extreamities. But if still they will persist, and go on in such pernicious Ways and Doctrines; good People and Pastors may withdraw themselves from their Communion, as St. Paul says in the places already cited. And the Reasons of breaking off, on such defections from necessary points, either of faith or practice, are still more urgent, if there is no Liberty left in any Churches, for other Pastors to stand up ministerially, or exercise their Ministry in defence of those necessary points, whilst they continue with, and adhere to them. For then, the Concealment and Suppression of necessary Truths, is made a condition of Communion; and other Pastors, if they will hold on with them, must suffer * that good thing, which has been committed to their Trust, to be extinguish'd, without standing up, according to their duty and solemn undertaking, to minister the same. Which will make it necessary for all, who will choose to stand by Christ and his Truths, rather than by such his Apostatizing Servants and Corrupters thereof, to depart from them. When therefore the Bishops and Pastors of any Church, fall off from ministring necessary Christian Doctrine or Worship; and especially when they come to allow their Communion to none, who will go on administring the same; they thereby loosen the bands of Union, and break that spiritual dependance and relation, which the People, and other inferiour Pastors, ought to have upon them. They are no longer the true Joynts, to compact the Members; nor the Head of Unity, to keep together the Body of the Church. And so it would be in the case of other Bishops, especially of those who espouse a Schism, and communicate with Anti-Bishops in opposition to the true Bishops, if they fall from ministring necessary Christian Truths, whether of Faith, or of Moral Doctrine and Worship, as in the fore-mentioned Cases."},{"instruction_id":"127","instruction":"What are some of the doubts and objections that people have raised about the late Popish Plot?","input":"","output":"A Full and Final Proof OF THE PLOT From the REVELATIONS: Whereby the TESTIMONY of Dr. TITƲS OATES and Mr. WILL.

This shews that surely it must bee a Doctrine of great comfort to the elect of God, because they so long and look for, and love the coming of Jesus Christ.

Because there is no salvation in any other, neither is there any other Name under Heaven given wherein we must be saved, Act. 4.12.

Yet after all, this ends only in the Popes Power to dispense as he saw Cause, with Persons of greater Rank or Merit, and greater Preferments. The Words are, Circa sublimes tamen & literatas Personas, quae * majoribus Beneficiis sunt honorandae, cum ratio pustulaverit, per Sedem Apostolicam poterit Dispensari. Here the Dispensing Power is fairly owned in the Canon it self. And in the other Case, of the Incapacity of Priesthood by Illegitimation; the same stout Pope declares, That it was in his Power to dispense with that too. The Case was this; The Church of Worcester, upon the Vacancy * of the See, had chosen the Arch-Deacon of York for their Bishop; he comes to the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury for Confirmation; but secretly confesses to him his Illegitimacy; (which came to the Popes Ear.) Upon Application to the Pope for his Confirmation, he demurs upon it. He could not deny that he had all other Qualifications: But there was a Canon of the former Lateran Council, which voided the Election of all Persons Illegitimate. So then the Business is at an end. Not so neither. His Predecessor could not hinder him from Dispensing in this Case; who had equal Power with himself. And there were many Reasons to induce him to grant him a Dispensation. Why then did he not give one? There was something else to be done first. The Dispensing Power must be owned by the Church of Worcester: And therefore they must first intreat the Pope to Dispense with him, by a humble Supplication; and then expect his Favour by Postulation. And so, for the present he voids his Election. Matt. Paris takes particular Notice, That in the Publication * of the Decretals by Gregory 9. This Power of Dispensing in these two Cases, was looked on as a great Innovation; but such as brought great Advantages to the Court of Rome. And the same Pope, saith Matt. Westminster, voided the Election of John Bloud to the See of Canterbury, because he had enjoyed * two Benefices with Cure of Souls, without a Dispensation.

For a King may do that which our Lord Christ in his state of humiliation would not do. He would not divide an inheritance among brethren, Luke 12. 13, 14. and yet a king may do it. For though Christ was King in right, yet he refused at that time to take upon him, or to execute the office of a King, but took upon him the form of a servant, Phil. 2. 7. And therefore a King on his throne is not debarred from doing that which Christ would not do in his debasement. And yet even then the Lord Christ did whip the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, John 2. 15, 16. Mat. 21. 12. I will not now dispute, whether Christ did this jure zelotarum, by the right that Zelots of the Law among the Jews, claimed to themselves; or jure Regio, by the right of a King, under which notion acclamation was made to him when he rode on an Ass into Jerusalem, Luke 19. 38. after which he did expel the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, ver. 45. nor whether this be a good proof for Magistrates, to intermeddle in matters of Religion, as it hath been argued by Mr. Cobbet of New England. It is sufficient for my present purpose, that the alledging of Christs example by these Petitioners, is so far from making against the Kings power in Ecclesiastical causes, that it rather makes for it. Nor is it against the Kings power in causes Ecclesiastical that the Lord Jesus himself, nor his disciples, never would by any outward force compel men to receive them or their doctrine. For, besides what is already said of Christs example, there is a great difference to be made between professed infidels, and disorderly Christians; between planting of the Gospel at first, and resorming Christians who have in shew received it, there may be reason to do the latter by civil penalties, though not the former, though men are not to be made Christians by civil penalties, sith Religion is not to be inforced, but perswaded, yet being Christians they may be corrected by civil penalties.

[ 1] First, Holy confession in godly men, makes the soul to be more active and inquisitive after cure, remedy, and pardon for sin: holy confession makes the soul industrious. I confesse sin, but how shall I subdue sin? I acknowledge sin; but how shall I get pardon for sin? It makes it enquire how to get cure and remedy for the evils which before were confest. Job. 7. 20. I have sinned, What shall I do unto thee, * O thou preserver of men? &c. I have sinned, there is his confession: Lord what shall I do? there is his industry. Thus the Jewes they were convinced by Peter of their great sin, insomuch as they cryed out, * What shall we do to be saved? But false confession leaves men idle, and carelesse: confesse they do, but they are not inquisitive how to get pardon for those sins they do confesse. [ 2] Secondly, Holy confession of sin unto God in godly men, is attended with remorse of conscience, and with grief of heart. Psal. 38. 18. For I will declare mine iniquity, I will be sorry for my sin: there is confession and sorrow joyned together. * Hos. 12. 4. Yea he had power over the Angel, and prevailed, he wept and made supplication unto him. Whilest confessions are in the mouth, there will be either tears in the eye, or sorrow in the heart, if confession be true. [ 3] Thirdly, A godly man in confession of sin, hath more freedom of spirit to confesse his particular sins in secret, then he hath in publick: I have powred out my soul before God, saith the Psalmist: confession of sin is a pouring out of the soul before God; he that can pour forth complaints"},{"instruction_id":"1229","instruction":"Can you please write a text in a formal and informative style discussing the concept that both good and evil things come from the hand of God, and that we should receive and make use of both?","input":"","output":"2.

But Contumelies and contempt, that are cast upon us for goodnesse should be born cheerfully, because they are confirmations of our conformity to Christ, and add weight to our Crownes. Therefore the Apostles rejoyced, that they were graced so, as to be disgraced for Christ, Act. 5. 41. The worlds smiles, may be resembled to the fruit that undid us all, which was faire to the sight, smooth in handling, sweet in tast; but deadly in effect, and operation. I would not, saith Luther, have the glory and fame of Erasmus; My greatest fear is, the praises of men. Yea, I rejoyce saith he, that Satan so rages and blasphemes: It is likely I do him and his Kingdom the more mischiefe. Whence Ierome told Austin, It was an evident signe of glory to him, that all Hereticks did hate and traduce him. To be praised of evill men (said Bion) is to be praised for evill doing: so the better they speak of a man, the worse, and the worse, the better; as being like the Blackamores, who (judging of beauty by contraries) paint the Angels black, and the Devils white. Or the Iewes, who preferred Barabas, before Iesus. Yet there are not a few, who feare the worlds opinion, more then Gods displeasure; which is to runne into the fire, to avoid the smoak; who more dread the mockes and flouts of men on earth, then they do the grinning mocks of the Devills in Hell; which makes them cease to be good Christians, that they may be thought good companions: wherein they put down AEsop's foolish fishes, that leap out of the warm water, into the burning fire for ease: or Timocrates, who, as Thucidides relates, kil'd himselfe for fear, least he should be drowned.

Such a Posture of Affairs seems to require, at least to justifie, such a qualified Submission. But, 1. This is a needless Distinction. For such a limitted Compliance cannot be justified, unless it's required, i. e. unless 'tis a Duty to comply. The Reason is, because no Subject is independent of the Constitution. He is not at liberty to qualifie his Allegiance at his Discretion, and to choose to submit to what Governour he pleases. Such a Latitude would make Subjection an Arbitrary Relation; which the People might throw off at their pleasure. For if their private unauthorized Will is sufficient to translate part of their Allegiance, the whole must, by the same Reason, lye at the Mercy of their Inclinations. Thus much is granted by the Doctor himself: For though at present he seems to make these Degrees of Submission no more than politick Provisions, and a little Ceremony to an approaching Revolution; yet when he comes to state the Business, he calls them Duties, and carves out several Branches of Allegiance, such as Praying, Paying Taxes, &c. under the notion of an Obligation; which is a sufficient Argument they are required to be done. 2."},{"instruction_id":"990","instruction":"What are some of the topics covered in the book \"The way to save Wealth by living well for 2d a Day\"?","input":"","output":"Also another Book Intituled the way to save Wealth by living well for 2d a Day, to save Coals, Shoes, Candles, Soap, and Cloth in making a shift, to Angle, order Bees and Silk-worms, Cattle Powltry, &c. to Improve Land by Hops, Flax, Liquorice to destroy Virmin, to speake by Signs; and 20 in the Room shall know nothing of it, aod by this means; cheating at Cards is plainly Demonstrated, to feed Horses fatt without Corn, Hay or Grass, with many other Curiosities.

Secondly, there can be no condition of man so servile or brutish, as to require an Arbitrary subjection: Nature has not exposed infants to this rigour, no nor beasts, and therefore much lesse any that have a larger use of reason: This condition does make Government absolutely necessary; but absolute Government it does not prove so much as expedient. Thirdly, if this condition did justifie Dominicall-Rule as to that respect, yet this justifies it not generally, and as the world has ever hitherto used it, and as it is commonly understood: No generous minde, no knowing man, no Polititian ought to be mancipated by this ground; and yet we know well, Slavery hitherto has observed no such distinction in the world. Fourthly, Servile Government does not onely shew it self iniurious and violent in devesting the propriety of those which are subjected to it, but also the more publike and sublime propriety; which the Common-wealth, the Society of Mankinde, nay God himself has in the parties enslaved. If the lord may destroy his slave at pleasure, then he may destroy that, which in part is belonging to another: then the condition of a slave is worse than of a beast, or any inanimate Cattels; and this is most unnaturall, and publikely detrimentall. Sic utere tuo, ne noceas alieno: sic utere privato, ne noceas publico. These are Maximes that restrain men from the abuse of any other things; nay, by these Rules, no man may abuse himself: yet these restrain not from abusing slaves; these deny not, but a lord may have a more confined power over his slave, than he has over himself.

Because the Lord Jesus himself, nor his disciples, would never by any outward force compel men to receive them or their doctrine; for when the disciples of Christ (supposing they might use violence as under the law) would have commanded fire to come from heaven (as Elias did) to consume them that would not receive them; Christ turned and rebuked, saying, ye know not what spirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them.

The mistake is continued, as if by acknowledging the King supreme Governor in spiritual things, he had a power given him to be Lord over anothers faith, which were indeed to ascribe that to the King, which the Pope takes on him, to determine what a Christian is to believe, which Hart the Jesuite imagined was given to the King by that Oath, but was rectified therein by Dr. John Rainold confer. with Hart, chap. 10. 2. If [ by imposing by outward force, any thing in the worship of God ] be meant of imposing on the conscience, the same mistake is continued, which I have before discovered: But if [ by outward force imposing any thing in the worship of God ] be meant of [imposing by civil penalties on the outward man, something in Gods worship] there is need of much caution to determine of their power."},{"instruction_id":"1635","instruction":"Can you please write a paragraph in the style of a medical instruction, using old-fashioned language and discussing the use of various ingredients and treatments for a specific condition?","input":"","output":"Sometimes a Fomentation of red Wine, with Venice Treacle, red Roses, and Mint infus'd in it hot, is very profitable.

So that, what the having of two Bishops in the same City at once, strikes at, is the Duty of Church-Unity. But where it could be tolerated without imputation of Schism, and was not destructive of the required Unity, (as it was not in those first beginnings of the Church, when God was pleased for a time to tolerate the former separation between Jews and Gentiles, till the Jews had out-grown their Prejudices against communion with Gentiles,) it was not destructive of, or inconsistent with the Being of Episcopacy.

Because another is their rightful Bishop, he can not be the Bishop of that place or Diocess, since they can not have two Bishops at once.

So that among such Anti-bishops and their adherents, we are to lament the loss of Unity and Church communion: but not of all Orders and Baptisms, as if, by such Schism, they were rendered utterly uncapable, either to baptize or ordain, and so were like to have neither Priesthood nor Christianity left among them."},{"instruction_id":"223","instruction":"What is the relationship between wealth, pleasure, virtue, and the pursuit of truth in the context of those who write for reward, and how does this relate to the preferences of Dionysius and the courtier?","input":"","output":"Those goodlie persons, if they be voide of virtue, maie wel be counted like faire clothes ouer a foule wal; big bladers ful of wind, yet of no waight.

But besides, in the Great Council at Clovesho, where AEthelbaldus, * King of Mercia, was present, and Cutbert, Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, with the other Bishops, this Charter of Withred's, * was read, and approved, and consirmed; with the like Sanction annexed to it. In the Council at Clovesho, A. C. 787. The extent of the Jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury was very much lessened by the means of King Offa, who caused another Archbishoprick to be set up in Mercia, and the Archbishop of Canterbury gave his Consent, saith Matt. Paris: But his former Jurisdiction was restored in the Council of Clovesho, A. D. 803. by a general Consent. But in the former Council the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction was strenuously asserted, in these Words; Sicut Reges * omnibus dignitatibus praesunt, ita & Episcopi in his quae ad Deum attinent. And in the latter, there is a severe denunciation against all that should lessen the Honour, or take away the Jurisdiction * of that See. From henceforward I find no Diminution of the Archbishop's Ordinary Jurisdiction through the Saxon times. The King had the Political Supremacy in him, by which he erected and divided Bishopricks, and nominated Bishops, and summoned Councils, and confirmed their Proceedings as he saw Cause; but the immediate Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction was left to the Archbishop of Canterbury in the first place, and to the rest of the Bishops As to any Publick Acts which related to Ecclesiastical Affairs, they were not dispatched by particular Commissions, but in the Parliamentary Assemblies; In which, the custom was, to begin with what related to the Church, and then to proceed to other Business. Of this Ingulphus gives us an Instance in Ceolnothus Archbishop of Canterbury; for in the Parliament Assembled at * Kingsbury, A. C. 851. in Hebdomada Pasch. (which was chiefly assembled pro Regni negotiis) yet even then, he proposed, That Church Affairs might be first dispatched; Divina Negotia debere primitus proponi; to which they all assented. And so Bertulphus his Charter of Crowland then passed; as Withlasius his did before, at a time when the Bishops and Nobles attended the King at London, to consult about the Danish Pyrates, which very much infested our Coasts. Thus AEthelwolfus passed his Famous Grant of the Tenth of all the Lands to the Church, in a Council at Winchester; himself, and the King • of Mercia and East-Angles, being present, and all the Nobility and Bishops giving their free Consent; as Ingulphus relates it.

R 's Position, that the inward Government of Christ is not represented by persons visible by carnal eyes, because he alone is Lord over the Conscience, as if the Government were out of Christ's hands, when his Spirit and Power acts through his Members. But alike truly may it be urged, that because God promised to teach his people himself, which John saw fulfilled when he told the Churches, Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you, 1 John 1.27. therefore no persons (visible by carnal Eyes) are invested with power from him to teach, he being the Bishop and Shepherd of the Soul: and so exclude the Office of Pastors and Teachers, as entrenching upon Christ's Prerogative.

For 1. It is not rightly supposed, that Princes have not in the days of the Gospel, a power in matters of Religion, which the Apostles and Elders in the Primitive times, had not. The contrary is proved in my Serious Consideration of the Oath of Supremacy, in the confirmation of the 4th. and 5th. Propositions. The Apostles and Elders, as messengers of Christ, and Pastors of the Church, had their peculiar authority, which Princes are not to usurp; and Princes have their peculiar power and authority, to which every soul is to be subject: neither have dominion over our faith; and, however Popes claim it, our Princes disclaim it. 2.

That which is there forbidden, is rule in the Apostles over one another, after the manner of the Kings of the Nations. 3. The Text, 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. is much less to the purpose, it being only a precept to Teachers and Elders of the Church, concerning the exercise of their Ecclesiastical function, nothing to the restraint of Princes from the exercise of their office, in things and causes spiritual. 4. The Apostles only perswading, shewing the terrours of the Lord, shaking off the dust of their feet, are ill alledged to exclude Princes from their power of governing all persons in all causes. The Apostles and Elders did not bear the sword as Princes do. It would be of very bad consequence, if in case of resistance they might do no more then the Apostles were to do in case their doctrine were received or opposed.

Sam. 12.8. The Lord would not haue gone against his owne law. 5. Therefore in this place, not the thing, but the manner thereof is forbidden: that he should not take many wiues, to giue himselfe to lust and pleasure, and so to neglect the office and dutie of the kingdome: Borr. for as the King is forbidden to multiplie horse, and gold, and siluer, so he is restrained from multiplying of wiues: but it was lawfull simply for the King to haue many horse, and to haue much siluer and gold, as Salomon had, but not to trust in them: So was it permitted vnto them, in respect of those times, to haue diuers wiues: so they vsed them not for lust and concupiscence, but for procreation: neither were addicted vnto them. 21.

But take they heed, lest leaving all reverence before God in his Assembly, God leave not them and their Assemblies. We know the disobedient are threatned to be smitten in the knees, and in the legges with a sore botch, that cannot be healed, Deut. 8.35. But is it disobedience not to bow the Knee at the Name of Jesus? Yes, for God that will not have it bow to Baal, 2 King. 19.18. hath sworne by himselfe it shall bow to him, Isa. 45.23. Nor may the common plea of old Testament hold, for it is applied unto Christ in the New, as meant to be fulfilled in and to him, Rom. 14.11. Nor may it be shifted off unto the generall day, no more then our confession. For if the time of grace be for the confession of the tongue, the acknowledgement of the Knee should be in the time of grace also. More of this at 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 , as more proper there. Isidore saith there is affinity betweene the Knees and the Eyes. * Because men, dum ad genua se prosternunt, statim lacrymantur, when they are on, or doe bend themselves toward their Knees, be aptest to weepe. If teares be so acceptable to God, that he, * as the Psalmist desireth, will bottle them up, can the posture be displeasing, which helps them forward? I doe not make this the Apostles argument, but this sheweth that bowing being of outward gestures the humblest, is also the heartiest. For it is a quick sense at the heart, that causeth teares to distill at the eyes. An outward, humble, and hearty motion, that is required. Holy Kings have performed it in the worship of God, as David, Psal. 95.6. Solomon, 1 King. 8.54. Ezechias, 2 Chron. 29.30. So did the Prophets, as Daniel, Dan. 6.10. Esras, Esr. 9.5. Micah, Mic. 6.6.

And so every Christian should say Your Holiness and Your Grace one to another. Next, how can they in reason claim any more titles, than were practised, and received by the Apostles and primitive Christians, whose successors they pretend they are, and as whole successors (and no otherwise) themselves, I judge, will confess, any honour they seek is due to them? Now, if they neither sought, received, nor admitted such honour, nor titles, how came these by them? If they say they did, let them prove it if they can: we find no such thing in the Scripture. The Christians speak to the Apostles without any such denominations, neither saying, If it please your Grace, Your Holiness, Your Lordship, nor your Worship: they are neither called My Lord Peter, nor My Lord Paul, nor yet Master Peter, nor Master Paul, nor Doctor Peter, nor Doctor Paul, but singly Peter and Paul, and that not only in the Scripture, but for some hundreds of years after. So that, this appears to be a manifest fruit of the Apostasie: for, if these titles arise either from the office or worth of the persons, it will not be denied, but the Apostles deserved them better, than any now; that call for them. But the case is plain, the Apostles had the Holiness, the Excellency, the Grace, and because they were Holy, Excellent and Gracious, they neither used nor admitted of such titles: but these, having neither Holiness, Excellency, nor Grace, will needs be so called, to satisfie their ambitious and ostentive minds, which is a manifest token of their Hypocrisie. Fifthly, as to that title of Majesty, usually ascribed to Princes, we do not find it given to any such in the Holy Scripture. But that it is specially and peculiarly ascribed unto God, as 1 Chron. 29.11. Job 37.22. Psal. 21.5.29.4.43.3.63.1.96.6. Isa. 2.10.24.14.26.10. Heb. 1.3. 2 Pet. 1.16. and many more places. Hence saith Jude, ver. 25. To the only Wise God our Saviour be Glory, and Majesty, &c. not to men. We find in Scripture the proud King Nebuchadnezzar. assuming this title to himself, Dan. 4.30. who at that time received a sufficient reproof, by a sudden Judgment which came upon him.

These Deputies being arrived at Turin, the Ambassadors thought it not convenient for them to appear at Court thus divided; but sent them back into the Valleys to endeavour a Union between themselves, and labour'd in the mean time to obtain a Truce for them. Their Enemies heard with a great deal of satisfaction, that the Communities were divided amongst themselves upon the point of departing; they were so well persuaded that this division would be an infallible means to destroy them, that they caused it to be carried on and fomented ever since, in those parts, by perfidious persons whom they had gained for that purpose. It is also to be presumed, that they never had proposed the expedient of departing, but with a prospect that it might be the occasion of the disunion of the Waldenses. To make advantage then of the variable dispositions of the Communities, their Enemies changed their minds once more. They had lately declared, That they expected, in the first place, that the Waldenses should themselves desire a permission to depart, and should make their Submissions thereupon.

And the name of those whom Christ hath given to his Church (for continuance) are Pastors and Teachers s , that's their distinct office; all Saints are not such, but there are some such for the perfecting of the Saints and the work of the Ministery, so that their work lies in teaching; they are men that labour in the Word and Doctrine t , that's their great business).

Therefore when they came together again the next day, the Propounder demanded of them, if Christ were already come, and who they thought he was: and to this demand, they gave this answer, That they thought Eliah was he, if he were come, because he came with great power, which he declared by slaying the Priests of Baal: and, for the fulfilling of the Scripture, he was oppressed by Ahab and Iezabel: yet they esteemed him to be more then a mortal man, because he so strangely ascended up into heaven. And because this opinion was contradicted by others, the day following they tooke into examination the same question, to answer them that said Eliah was not the Messiah. They of the contrary opinion did urge the care and love of Eliah, for the good of their Nation, in that he left them Elisha his disciple to teach and instruct the people; which they expect to be the care of their Messiah.

First, This is a time of Prosecution, and a  time of Adversity is a proper time for Consideration, and Consideration is a means to make us hold fast that which is good, and  reject that which is evil. I beseech you, make such advantage of this Juncture. Sit down, and think once more of the Nature of this Church. Confer with the  Guides of the National Religion; read without prejudice, the Books commended by  them to you. Peruse seriously the Books which Authority hath set forth. Some  who have spoken against them, have by their own confession, never read  them. Examine, and Judge. Many of your Scruples have arisen from what you have  heard, and read; they would not have otherwise been ingendred in your Minds. Hear and Read for your Information, as well as your entanglement. Secondly, Do as much as you can do. Do as much as the Dissenters, who are most eminent for Learning, Piety, Preaching,  Writing, Experience, and Fame; sometimes actually do. They have owned  our Communion to be lawful. * They have received the Communion kneeling. They Page  [unnumbered] have bred up Children to the Ministry of this Church. They have  joyned in the Liturgy. They have been Married according to the Form of it. Nay,  one who assisted in making the Directory, would have his own Daughter  (in those times) be Married in the way of the Book of Common-Prayer. * Do as the antient Non-conformists did, who  would not separate, though they feared to Subscribe: Who wrote with such Zeal  against those of the Separation, that Mr. Hildersham was called, ‖ The Maul of the Brownists. Do more for the Peace of God's Church, then for a Vote, or  Office, or Fear of Legal Penalty. Come as Christians to the Sacrament, and not as Politicians. Those who have so done, yet break the unity of  the Church, are said to use the Arts of Jesuites, and to be without all excuse,  by a Dissenter * who  writes with commendable temper. Do constantly what you do upon occasion. No Preaching, or Praying, which is better liked, can ballance  the evil of Separation from a Church, which imposeth no terms of Communion  which are sinful.

Profit many times comes in freely; as the Bee brings her hony like a sweet seruant to the hiue; and gathering from many things, labours to enrich onely one: but there is small profit to take from one, and disperce amongst many. Profit is got by labour; and labour that brings profit, is sweet to the patient: but the impatience of a foole that wil not persist, nor can stay to expect, loseth his profit, and may leaue off his trade.

Again, on the tenth day of the same Month, we were called before the Court; And when we came before them, the Deputy-Governor made a Speech to this effect: These men have been formerly here, and they have been sent avvay; and though they know the Law, yet are come again in contempt, and to revile Magistrates and Ministers, and to break all order in Churches, and deceive the people; and so what ever become of them, whether loss of ears, or loss of life, your blood be upon your own heads. [Mark, worse then Pilate, and the envious Jews. ] To which he vvas replyed, you heap false accusations upon us, and God will heap his judgements upon your heads; and if we suffer either loss of member, or loss of life, our blood will be required at your hands, for the Lord hath sent us hither.

Therefore faith is a vision of things not appearing, and it brings vs to the same certainty, to the which wee are brought by things which are seene. So that neyther about the obiect of things which are seene, can it bee called credulity, or incredulity: nor againe can it be called faith, but when a man hath certainty concerning those things which are not seene, more than concerning those things which are seene. For because those things which are yet in hope, are reputed as yet without substance, or subsistence, and faith giueth vnto them their substance; not that it addes any thing vnto them, but it selfe is the substance or subsistence of them: For the purpose; the resurrection is not yet fulfilled, not yet present or subsistent, but faith makes it to subsist in our soule: this is it which the Apostle calleth 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 , or substance.

Iosephas (says he) describes him by those Characters, by which we may be sure that he was not the same Sanballat. If you ask what Characters they are, (he says) First, that this was a Chuthaean, of that race from which the Samaritans came; and f • rther, that he was sent to be Governour of Samaria by the last Darius; whereas this Gentleman tells us of this other Sanballat, that he was a Moabite of Horonaim, whom Nehemiah found in Palestine 100 years before in Artaxerxes his time. But first, The Scripture doth not plainly say of Nehemiahs Sanballat, either that he was a Moabite, or of Horonaim; it only calls him the Horonite, whether from Horonaim, or from some other place, is uncertain. But to pass this, secondly, He might be a Chuthaean originally, and yet his Habitation might have been for the most part at Horonaim, and he thereupon call'd the Horonite. Thirdly, Arch-bishop Vsher, Grotius, and others think that he was Toparch, or Deputy-Governour of the Moabites; and it is in no wise improbable, that the same person, who was constituted Governour of the Moabites by Artaxerxes, should afterwards be advanc'd to be Governour of Samaria by Darius. Fourthly, As to that of 100 years, they who hold Nehemiah 's Artaxerxes to be Longimanus, must grant that Nehemiah found Sanballat in Palestine 100 years before the time of the last Darius, (and they say that he liv'd to so great an age that that might be,) but Sulpitius Severus, and those that follow him, must and do deny it. Thus it appears, that we cannot be sure that he was not the same Sanballat, either by the Characters by which Josephus describes him, or by any thing which this Gentleman saith.

I do not know whether our conformity to them, as to these particulars, goes so high, or is so Universal, yet something like it we have. Great Zeal has appeared against the Idolatry of the Church of Rome, with a constancy in the Matters of Religion, that has amazed all the World: the steps made towards that, alarmed the Nation, and this City in particular: and it appeared that you could not bear those who called themselves the Church of God, but that are the Synagogue of Satan.

Objection 6 th. The Covenant cannot be binding, because the Parties dealt craftily with us. Answer I. England is not our Party that we covenanted with, but all the 3 Lands together, as one Party, and God the other Party with whom they covenanted. II. Consider Josh: 9. and you will find how little weight this Objection hath in Matter of Covenanting: It's said in the 4 th Verse, They did work wilily, and went as if they had been Ambassadours, yet Joshua & the Princes entred into Covenant with them, and when it was broken, the Land of Israel did smart for it. Objection 7 th. The Covenant binds us to things that are not particularly set down, but are so general as keep us in doubt; the Ground whereof is this, because we swear in general to endeavour the Reformation of England, according to the best Reformed Churches; but these Churches were not particularly set down and pitched upon: therefore it cannot stand. Answer I. If there be any Man that would have a more particular Rule than the Word of God for Reformation, he must be sent to another Land to seek another Gospel from Jews or Turks ; and if it be so, then there is not a Rule among us.

And it is Fanaticism properly so called, or Religious Frenzie, to lay aside a more probable means, and to trust that God will give, to means which are much less probable, supernatural aid and success. God supporteth a good Cause by weak means (if they are the only means he hath put into our power) agaisnt a bad Cause though externally potent.
